# Archetype Shifting the Burden Ontology

Welcome to the Archetype Shifting the Burden Ontology repository. This ontology is designed to model the systems thinking archetype "Shifting the Burden". The ontology is represented in the Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) format, a popular syntax for expressing data in the Resource Description Framework (RDF).

## About the Project

The Shifting the Burden archetype is a system structure that shows how a system compensates for a problem with a short-term solution that ultimately undermines a long-term solution. This ontology aims to provide a structured and formal representation of this archetype, enabling more effective analysis and understanding.

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up your local environment to interact with the ontology.

### Prerequisites

To interact with this ontology, you will need to have Protégé installed on your machine. Protégé is a free, open-source ontology editor and a knowledge management system.

- [Download Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/products.php#desktop-protege)
